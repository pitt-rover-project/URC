Moving around:
   u    i    o
   j    k    l
   m    ,    .

q/z : increase/decrease max speeds by 10%
w/x : increase/decrease only linear speed by 10%
e/c : increase/decrease only angular speed by 10%
anything else : stop

i= move forward (linear.x > 0)
,= move backward (linear.x < 0)
j= turn left (angular.z > 0)
l= turn right (angular.z < 0)
u= move forward and turn left 
o= move forward and turn right
m= move backward and turn left
.= move backward and turn right
k= stop (linear.x = 0, angular.z = 0)

positive angular = right
negative angular = left

positive linear = forward
negative linear = backwards
